Heres what i said:
Hey,
I was wondering if i can get a refund or replacement with a champion, i have accidentally
purchased Nautilus instead of Vladimir which was a big mistake. I sent you guys a email but had
no response for a long time. I still haven't received back an email, i am disapointed in this
service i am getting.
Thanks.

Greetings Summoner,
We do not do this normally, but I was able to make an exception and have refunded this
content for you.
The points have been added to your account, but they may not display properly until you go to
the Store and attempt to make a purchase. You do not need to complete the purchase as the
value should correct itself before you complete the transaction.
If you happen to have been online while I was operating on your account, you may notice a
short ~5 minute hold on your account. This is just to allow the database to re-sync and will be
over shortly.
This is a one-time exception. Your account is no longer eligible for any further refunds or
changes to your current request as the refund has been completed.
Just to let you know I have closed this request. If you have any other questions that are not
related to this refund please feel free to create a new request here:
